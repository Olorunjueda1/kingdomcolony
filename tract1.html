        </div>

      <p>The Christian holy book called the Bible says God is Love. But if God is Love and He is not wicked why did he plant the tree of knowledge of good and of evil in the garden where he kept the first man and woman Adam and Eve,
        knowing full well that, they could eat out of it and die?</p>
        <p>If God is not wicked why did He cast out Satan from heaven unto the earth? Is it because He could not manage Satan that led to His sending him (i.e. Satan) to where His images are, so that Satan can be causing problems for them?</p>
        <p>For what reason did God create dangerous animals like the lion, the leopard, and the snake etc, when He knows that they could be destructive to the people he created in his own image?</p>
        <p>Why is it that it is the wicked that prosper most often on earth? Why is it that the righteous dies untimely? Why is it that the witches, wizards and familiar spirits live long before they die, if God is not wicked?</p>
        <p>If God is not wicked why did he destroy the first world and saved only eight people? If he is not wicked why did he burned Sodom down and saved only Lot and his family. If God is not wicked and partial, why did he destroy all the seven nations that inhabited Canaan land, for the Israelites to occupy it?</p>
        <p>Many today are striving with God ignorantly and to strife with one’s maker is a curse according to the Bible. Who is man to query God? But by the way, is God actually wicked? Is He wicked at all? God is not wicked. Indeed God is Love as His Holy book has said. He loves all His creatures, not only those created in his image.</p>
        <p>God is God and we, his image, are made gods also. God called us gods. The God of heaven and earth make us gods so that we also may rule and reign over all other things he created including the Elephant, the Lion, the Snake, etc. Satan and his demons are not excluded from what to reign over.</p>
        <p>This attribute was demonstrated by Adam. May I ask you, who gave names to all the animals created by God? Was it not Adam? God created man with Glory that Satan, animals or demons could not withstand.</p>
        <p>As gods we have will power. If we are called gods by God and we have not our own will, it means we are not gods. In this regards, the tree of knowledge of good and evil that was in the garden was to test our father Adam whether he would use his will power well or not. Was he not told that whenever he ate it he would die? Adam violated the will of his maker. Why must he listen to a strange voice (Satan)? He listened to a strange voice and also acted on the instructions of that strange voice. DISOBEDIENCE!</p>
        <p>Of a truth Satan did not force him to eat. He willingly gave in to Satan and so he willingly through that act, sold his glory to Satan who took over the world from him and that was why the spirit of Satan (wickedness, pride etc) enter into man and beasts.</p>
        <p>The first world made God regret creating man, and though he sent Noah to them, they refused to listen to him. Supposing Noah and his children refused to enter the ark what would have happened? They would have perished also. The then world refused simple message of salvation and they all perished.</p>
        <p>Seven nations that inhabited Canaan land wearied God with their rituals, killing of their children for idols, sin of incest, fornications and adultery. These and many more made God to wipe them away for his chosen people.</p>
        <p>Brother and sister, God is not wicked. He loves you and as he sent Noah to the people of the first world so he is sending me to you through Jesus who has destroyed Satan and his influence over those that accepts Him as Lord and Savior. If you can only renounce Satan and his demons, if you can only confess your sins and forsake them, if you can only now tell Jesus to have the whole of you, then you will be saved from that great destruction that is waiting for Satan and his followers, then you will recover back the lost glory that Adam lost to Satan. Then also you will now begin to rule and reign both here on earth and in the heaven to come over all what God’s created.</p>
        <p>COME TO GOD THROUGH JESUS TODAY. NO ANY OTHER WAY LEST YOU CONTINUE TO SAY GOD IS WICKED IN HELL</p>
        <p>Now, join a Bible believing Church, Study your Bible (If you don’t have one, get one) and pray daily.</p>
