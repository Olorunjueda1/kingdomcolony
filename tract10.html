          <h1 class="header-2">SQUARELY FACING THE REALITY OF LIFE</h1>
        </div>

      <p>Many used to dodge or hide behind a finger and they think that no one sees them. Many do hide in churches or denominations and they think their sins are covered.</p>
        <p>Some claim to be born again because they were baptized by immersion into water, others see themselves as sanctified and Holy Spirit filled just because they are appointed as leader in the church; whereas, sin is still the Lord and king of their lives. Many, because of unreadiness to face the reality of life, run away from where the truth is been hammered while some run from where the truth and power of God is manifesting, because of their sins which may soon be revealed by the truth and the power of the Holy Ghost. But when they are asked for the reasons for their leaving they give flimsy excuses.</p>
        <p>In the secular job, some do run away because of their laziness but they tell people that their boss is wicked. Some, when they know that their secret will soon be discovered because of failure to operate correspondingly with their certificate, they quickly abscond from duty. While some have abused and misused themselves before marrying and are still keeping it away from their spouse, others have during their youthful age contacted chronic venereal diseases which have since damaged their reproductive system. Yet they refused to make it known to those who will help them. Some have used their tongues to receive curses from people, while other received their curses by breaking covenant made with one partner or the other.</p>
        <p>Why are you covering your sin? Don’t you know it will hinder you from prospering (Prv. 28:13) why can’t you face the reality of your life now? Heaven will only help those that help themselves.</p>
        <p>Why are you troubling your Pastor and Doctors when you know where your problem emanated from?</p>
        <p>Why troubling your spouse when you know that you are the brain behind you problem?</p>
        <p>Why troubling your parent by wasting their resources when you know your ability?</p>
        <p>Why are you deceiving yourself? You know you can’t do away with opposite sex and you refused to marry?</p>
        <p>You know what lust is doing against your soul yet you will be claiming to be holy and sanctified.</p>
        <p>Why are you masturbating, my ‘born-again’ and ‘heaven tomorrow’ brethren?</p>
        <p>Why hiding away those properties from your Christian leaders and brethren? Why are you keeping them under your bed inside your bedroom and openly preaching against those that are using them? Are you not a hypocrite then? Jesus hates hypocrites (Mt. 23). Brethren, Jesus is still waiting for you to repent that is why he is delaying his coming. Repent of all your sins today by facing the reality of life squarely. You don’t need to be talking evil of your leaders and members outside the Church and still continue with that Church. If you do, you cannot be blessed through those leaders. You know that your problem is more than five minutes prayers, yet you remain there as a proof of your faithfulness to your denomination and not to Christ Jesus, while your problem worsens every day.</p>
        <p>Repent today and trace your step to where your solution will come from, that is Jesus. Jesus wants you to be free from your sin, but you may need to go through deliverance; before holiness experience comes in reality.</p>
        <p>JESUS IS LORD! Appear before him upright and you will enjoy his uprightness.</p>
