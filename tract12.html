          <h1 class="header-2">RESTING BEFORE REST</h1>
        </div>

        <p>An athlete that is leading the country race competition but before getting to the winning point decides to rest awhile will surely fail in topping the list of the winners.</p>
        <p>The resting before getting to the rounding up point is a breach of the rule of the game.</p>
        <p>Also, a pilgrim that has not gotten to his destination before giving him/herself to rest will definitely get there late and if luck is totally against him/her the position might have been taken over before getting there.</p>
        <p>Christians are pilgrims in this world and must never seek repose; for the resting place of Christians is not here; but heaven. The rules of pilgrimage that guide believers must not be broken. If your are to get to that eternal rest. Resting here in the days of your pilgrimage as a Christian, will lead you to sin, compromise of your faith and even complete renunciation of your faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
        <p>A believing spinster that moves too close to brothers will soon rest from her holiness and yield to fornication. So also, a serious bachelor in Christ that only has sisters as his best friends will soon loose out to fornication.</p>
        <p>A believer that believes in looking at everything around him/her, hearing all things apart from the words of God, who says anything that comes to his mind, who believes in satisfying his stomach with whatever kind of food desires, who never denies his hand from handling or touching some bad things, who never cautions his legs from carrying him to evil places and who never destroys his/her sexual urge is already resting when he/she ought to keep moving to the eternal rest prepared for victorious soldiers.</p>
        <p>The young prophet in (I king 13) rested when he ought to continue with his journey and evil caught up with him.</p>
        <p>He believed a lie that took him out of the will of God, he ate and drank with his mouth because of the inability to deny the quest of his stomach, he also destroy himself through too much talking: for through it he revealed the secret of his pilgrimage to Samaria. At last, he dies miserably.</p>
        <p>David, the man after God’s heart rested when he should not and he saw what he should not see. Not only that, he felt like touching with his hand what he saw with his eyes and eventually went into the act of adultery with Bathsheba the wife of Uriah which at last brought curse upon him and his generations.</p>
        <p>Christian, seek no repose, you are in the midst of enemies, be careful.</p>
        <p>Why are you not zealous as you were when you first believed?</p>
        <p>Are you committed still? Are you given to evangelism?</p>
        <p>Is the love of the world, especially material things of the world not replacing the love of God in you?</p>
        <p>Have football, computers, browsing, films etc not taken over the love of God in your life? LOOK! YOU ARE RESTING ALREADY.</p>
        <p>Stand up and leave that point for it is dangerous for you.</p>
        <p>The Israelites that decided to rest in the wilderness because of their unbelief failed to enter His rest “take heed brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God”.</p>
        <p>Fire on, behave as our fathers, for they said that “Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come” seek for where you will REST with the Lord Jesus forever NOW.</p>
