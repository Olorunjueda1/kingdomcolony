        <p>Chico and Shamg were friends right from primary school. They went to the same secondary school and proceeded to the same university. After their youth service, they both gained beautiful employment to different companies but in the same town.</p>
        <p>After two years in service, Chico got married and was later blessed with two boys and Chico decided after agreeing with his wife not to give birth to children any longer.</p>
        <p>Despite the achievement that Chico was making in every area, especially martially, Shamg never saw any reason or need to get married. He just discovered that he was having no interest in marriage at all until Chico went to the Lord on his behalf for several years. Then Shamg began to have interest in marriage.</p>
        <p>Not long after Shamg became engaged with a sister and when it remained about six months to his wedding, he felt sick. In the course of his treatment, it was discovered that one of his kidney was bad. There was nothing that could be done except transplanting of kidney or else he would die. When Chico decided to offer himself, he knew that if he died, he had his image behind, but if Shamg should die, it will just be like a snake that passed on the rock whose path cannot be traced after its passage.</p>
        <p>Shamg became okay with the kidney of his friend but, Chico could not survive it. He later died, even before his friend wedded. Though no one told Shamg what his friend did to sustain his life until the writing of Chico was delivered to him after his death. And Shamg nearly killed himself when he realized what his friend did for him. In fact, he made himself slave to the wife and children of Chico. So that they may not feel the departure of their father.</p>
        <p>Love in Tokyo? Somebody did more than that for you and me. In fact, Chico wouldn’t have died if not that he gave himself to the curses fighting that marriage to his friend.</p>
        <p>Jesus is our own Chico, who carried all the curses of human race right from the Garden of Eden up till one left for our lives.</p>
        <p>Without the shedding of blood no forgiveness of sins, no breaking of curses and evil inherited covenants. Jesus has shed his blood for you and for me: for it is written cursed is he that is hung on the tree and so Jesus who knew no sin was made a curse for you and me for our fulfillment in every area of our lives (Gal 3: 13-14).</p>
        <p>Chico died so that Shamg may be fulfilled martially. Jesus went to the cross and died so that you too may be fulfilled spiritually, physically, matrimonially and eternally.</p>
        <p>Shamg recognized the deed of his friend, therefore he made himself slave to the wife and children of his friend. You too must recognize the deed of Jesus, by loving his word every day.</p>
        <p>“For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, justified by his blood; we shall be saved from wrath though him” Roman 5: 6-9.</p>
