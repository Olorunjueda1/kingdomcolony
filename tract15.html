          <h1 class="header-2">WHY WORRY, IS NOT DEATH THE END?</h1>
        </div>

        <p>The belief of many is that, death is the end of everything on earth. Some believe that whether you have food to eat or not, the moment death closes your eyes, that is all. Other believes that, no matter how wicked or good a person can be the day death strikes is the end of everything.</p>
        <p>This belief has being right from the time of the bible “come, they say let get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant” Isaiah 56: 12. Why are the people of the bible saying so? Because they thought the end of all sorrow or enjoyment in life is death and nothing more. Hear them again “And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die” Isaiah 22:13.</p>
        <p>Is this not the thought of many today? Is that not the reason why you keep on doing evil and care not what will happen to you after death? Is that not why human life is worthless before you? Is that not why you sit on the money and the right of other people? Is that not the reason why you enjoy life at the expense of other people’s sweat and sorrow?</p>
        <p>Death indeed in imminent. It is our unavoidable end that will certainly come. But after figure six the adage says, are many numbers. Death is just a bridge that links man with timeless time. It is just a ladder to carry human race to another world without end. Death is a necessary end that come to man for him to receive judgment of what he did in the flesh Heb. 9:27</p>
        <p>Your one hundred and twenty years is not up to three hours of the Almighty God. “For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night (Psalm 90:4).</p>
        <p>Fellow reader, death is not the end of everything; you will receive the reward of what you are doing presently if you repent not before death come. “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened…” book of stealing and robbery etc were opened, “and another book was opened which was the book of life; and the dead were judge out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works” Rev 20:13.</p>
        <p>“And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire”. Rev. 20:15.</p>
        <p>Readers, many books of your offences can be burnt today if you can allow Jesus Christ to write your name in the book of life. Except you are found in Jesus by receiving Him as your Lord and Saviour, your sins written in those books will be crying for your eternal destruction before God. Renounce all those sins today and Jesus will silence their cry by His shed blood.</p>
        <p>Accept Jesus today and live with Him eternally. There is life after death and there is damnation, torture and eternal death after physical death.</p>
        <p>Which one do you want to choose?</p>
        <p>Choose life and live with Christ forever.</p>
