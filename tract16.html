          <h1 class="header-2">LIFE AFTER DEATH</h1>
        </div>

        <p>There was a man whom God blessed so richly. The wealth was so much to the extent of changing his dress almost every four hours. He also ate all kind of food that pleased his soul. He had as many wives as possible and so many were his concubines.,</p>
        <p>This man, because of his riches lived a kind of careless and Godless life. He felt with his wealth he could do and undo. In fact the man was very rich.</p>
        <p>Within that environment where this rich man lived, was a holy, poor man who was sick as a result of lack of food. At time he went to this rich man’s house to eat from his dust bin. Several times the rich man saw this man yet had no compassion on him.</p>
        <p>One day God decided to call the holy poor man home to rest eternally; for he died, and the angels came and ushered him to heaven where he put off the body of corruption for a celestial body. Not many days or months after the death of the holy poor man, the rich man also died. And befitting state burial was given to him; but because he used not his earth to prepare for his heaven, he had since then landed in hell were no wealth is recognized. Where there is no respect of peace for people, except torture of the burning fire and its maggot that never dies.</p>
        <p>While the rich man was languishing in hell the holy but poor man was enjoying in heaven and so he has been until now and shall be forever.</p>
        <p>Life after death is real.</p>
        <p>Do you know that you are made of the dust?</p>
        <p>Do you know that, that which is moving you around, that is talking in you, causing you to see, hear; small is what the Lord breathed into your body of dust? That thing inside your body of dust never dies. It will either live with God forever or remain in hell forever. When men die physically it is the body of dust that will go back to where it comes from (dust). “Now this I say brethren, that flesh (dust) and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption (1 Cor. 15:50).</p>
        <p>For you my reader to live with God after death, whether you are rich or poor, young, worker or applicant, you need to forsake your wickedness. Fornication and adultery is wickedness, forsake it, it is corruption, it will deny you of incorruption; occultism, drunkenness, murder, stealing etc is wickedness and it will rob you of heaven with God.</p>
        <p>Your body that may be demanding for immorality and pleasure is going nowhere after death; but your spirit and soul will either be in heaven or hell forever.</p>
        <p>The rich man wanted to come back to the world when he saw the holy poor man in father Abraham’s bosom with enjoyment, but the wicked rich man who thought life ends on earth could not be comforted and all his pleas to come back to the world failed; for it was too late. Luke 16:19-26.</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus today and accept Him as your Lord and Savior, then your eternal life shall be secured. Salvation is gotten here on earth but shall be used in heaven. Accept Him now before it becomes too late.</p>
        <p>Heaven is real: hell is real: where will you spend your life after death?</p>
