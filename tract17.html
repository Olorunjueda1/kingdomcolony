          <h1 class="header-2">MY LIFE JACKET</h1>
        </div>

        <p>Without motor accident, the use of safety belt is defeated. Without boarding a ship, need for life jacket is useless. So also, without plane crash, the use of a parachute is needless.</p>
        <p>Everybody on earth is a traveler and we are making headway on our journey everyday as we sleep and wake up. A child conceived and gives birth to; commence his/her journey right from the birth.</p>
        <p>Many today have not got to the half of the journey of their life before they died, because they did not put on their life jacket or their safety belt.</p>
        <p>Many years back (1980s) a 504 wagon took off from Lagos to Kaduna, on getting to Padongari in Niger state, the man sitting in the front put on his safety belt; crossing to Kaduna state and precisely to Brinigwari, the vehicle ran into a river through the bridge and out of seven passengers (driver inclusive) only the man that used his safety belt was saved from the accident, all other died.</p>
        <p>Human beings in this world are travelers, and pot holes, dangerous bends and bridges are on the road, there is need for life jacket for safety in our journey home.</p>
        <p>Since the coming into world of everybody is not unknown to God; he is always ready to see you through; for he knows the road and the route we are passing through more than our first driver (mother and father), he knows the route more than our other drivers like: Teachers, Pastors, Mallams or occultist priests and herbalists.</p>
        <p>He knows how rough, dangerous and difficult the road is and as a result he provided us with the life jacket that will save us from pre-mature death and eternal death. He provided us the blood of his only begotten Son. The blood that conquer death on the road, the blood that conquer Satan and his works, the blood that conquer demons, the blood straightens the bends of our road, that fill the pot holes, that widens the narrow bridges, the blood of Jesus, the righteous and sinless Son of God.</p>
        <p>The righteousness of our driver and ours are like fifthly rag before God, Isaiah 64:6 that was why he gave us the blood of Jesus which Satan could not conquer as that of first Adam was. He gave us the blood that speaks life and better things than the blood of righteous Abel (Heb. 12:24).</p>
        <p>Do you want to fulfill your years and end up with God in eternity? You need divine life jacket (Jesus). Do you want to escape satanic traps and accident? You need divine life jacket (Jesus). Do you want to be free from the cage of Satan and escape being offered for sacrifice at any of their evil meetings and ceremonies? You need the divine life jacket (Jesus).</p>
        <p>He says ‘As many as come to me, I will not cast away.’ Also he says that His name (Jesus) is a strong tower; the righteous in Him runs therein and is safe. Prov. 18:10. He has shed his blood for the remission of your sins (Mt. 26:28).</p>
        <p>All you need to do to get the divine life jacket is just to confess and forsake your sins Pro. 28:13, 1 John 1:9 and accept His righteousness by confessing and accepting Him (Jesus) as your Lord and Saviour and you will be saved.</p>
