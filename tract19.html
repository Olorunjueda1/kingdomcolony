        </div>


        <p>A religion is a particular system of faith and worship. It is also known as any practice that someone or some group is seriously devoted to. Another dictionary gives the meaning of religion as an institution to express belief in a divine power.</p>
        <p>You may want to ask how religion kills, if the meaning of religion is as stated above? Yes! No religion without it does and don’t. our faith or belief in such religion will make us to keep those does and don’t even when it is not convenient for us. But the question is this, how many people can actually keep those does and don’ts? Also, how many of those divine powers that worship today are actually divine? Sango was a man like you and he come and died. Ogun also, was born like you and also died and was buried. Though these people exhibited some unusual powers during their life time, which make their people to turn them to gods after their death; yet they have their dos and don’ts of which no matter how they follow them, they too will die miserably as their gods died.</p>
        <p>No religion in the world gives life. And if religion gives no life it means, it gives the opposite (death). If a religion only kills, Ogun religion kills, Sango religion kills, Judaism kills as a religion, Christianity as a religion kills and Islamic religion kills. All religions in the world of today and before kills.</p>
        <p>The reason why all these religion kills is because all of their worshippers keep to the dos and don’ts of their religion of which could not give them life. Some of the founders of these religions could not even say emphatically where he is going after death. Yet, their followers became fanatical to dos and don’t of this religion.</p>
        <p>At mount Sinar where God gave the Ten Commandments to the people, despite all the glory of the Almighty which they saw they went after idol and about three thousand of them died Exodus 32:28. All efforts and mercy shown to Israelites to worship God in holiness and righteousness failed. But when God saw that religion will only ruin his people He decided to come and give back His life to men. “for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” John 3:16.</p>
        <p>Jesus says further in John 1027-28 “my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish neither shall my man pluck them out of my hand”</p>
        <p>Jesus in John 41:6 says “I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me”. The only way for you and me to escape death is to accept Jesus and forsake our religions that kills. Jesus did not come to us to give us Christian religion, it was the people of Antioch that saw the disciples behaviours and gave them the name Christians meaning little Christ. Acts 11:26. In such, you are making a great mistake if you take Christianity as religion. For it is not but a way of life to live to please God, serve God, love God, love fellow human being and end up in heaven.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the day Jesus was to commission His disciple in the both of Act of Apostle Chapter2: that same day the same number of people that died the day the law was received in Exodus 32: 28, were saved in the day of Holy Spirit Baptism in Acts 2:41.</p>
        <p>You too can be blessed with life of God today if you can forsake your religion and accept another life (Jesus Christ) into your life. God bless you.</p>
