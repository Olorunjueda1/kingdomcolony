      <p>A child will ever be looking to his parents for whatsoever help he may be expecting. A baby who though cannot walk, yet behold the face of his mother for carrying or putting him on the back. When a baby is crying he is doing so to call the attention of the mother.</p>
        <p>psalmist said. “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help, my help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth”.</p>
        <p>The psalmist was not looking up to his position as King over God’s people, he was not looking to the witches and wizards of the land for help, he was not looking up to his weapons and the soldier that were under his control for his deliverance but as a son to the makers of heaven and earth, he looked unto him for all he needed</p>
        <p>Why are you still a sinner? Is it not the fear of chronic financial uncertainty that makes you continues in prostitution? Why are you still a witch or wizard? Is it not because of the protection of Satan you thought you will forfeit, if you should renounce witchcraft? But does Satan protect? Why are you still stealing? Because you thought without it you will not be able to sustain yourself again? Why are dressing seductively? To quickly get a man that will propose you for immorality? Why are you disassociating yourself from believers? So that you may have the chance to dress anyhow, behave any how; carry boys and girls the way you like.</p>
        <p>If God is not wicked why did he destroy the first world and saved only eight people? If he is not wicked why did he burned Sodom down and saved only Lot and his family. If God is not wicked and partial, why did he destroy all the seven nations that inhabited Canaan land, for the Israelites to occupy it?</p>
        <p>Why are you flirting about? To get money to take care of your self, your children, and as an indigent student, to sponsor yourself in school?</p>
        <p>Why can’t you behave as the psalmist who looked unto God and his help came? Or didn’t you know that you will give account of how you use your body, time, beauty, money, knowledge etc. Don’t you know that God sent his son Jesus to the world to die for you to set you free from sin and to deliver you from the bondage of Satan? Don’t you know that he came so that you may be free from eternal curse that is sending unbelievers to hell fire?</p>
        <p>Psalm 34:5 says “They looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed” if you look unto Jesus shame will be off your life. You cannot look up to Him that was pierced and still remain in darkness of confusion, bareness, marital failure, evil dream, attacks etc.</p>
        <p>Until the Israelites that were bitten of that snake, looked up unto serpent of bronze hung by Moses they were neither healed nor delivered, and all those that believed not died prematurely. Jesus also said “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of man be lifted up that whatsoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life” John 32:14-15. It is your looking to Jesus that will deliver you from death eternal and at the same time give you hope of fulfillment here on earth, and in heaven.</p>
        <p>Hear again John 12:32 “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me”. You look unto Jesus and be saved from your sins and trouble, look to Jesus and be saved from failure, bareness, premature death, curses, evil covenant demonic attack and sickness. Look unto Him by trusting him, believing in Him, accepting Him as your Lord and savior and by renouncing all your known and unknown sins, then you will see him meeting all the needs of your life, and granting all your heart’s desire.</p>
        <p>Rev. 1:7 say “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and kindred’s of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen,” if you look up to Him now for your salvation and deliverance, you will not wail when he shall appear with the clouds.</p>
        <p>LOOK TO JESUS AND GET HOPE OF FULFILLMENT HERE ON EARTH AND IN HEAVEN.</p>
