          <h1 class="header-2">WHO CAN BE SAVED</h1>
        </div>

      <p>One God, one Lord, one Savior. But people today have married themselves to so many gods, Lords and saviors.</p>
        <p>Many, in trying to see God or to know Him, make graven images; some represent God with stones, head of birds or animals. God is not in those forms. God is just like you, because you are created in his image.</p>
        <p>Since Adam fell, to do the will of Jehovah becomes difficult; because the flesh is always there to work against the spirit. Man has his own will and God has his own. Man finds it difficult to marry the will of God, and as a result continually does his own as well as that of the prince of darkness.</p>
        <p>Your own will cannot save you, neither can the will of Satan. Why? Because Satan could not save himself from pride that made him a cast away forever. He could not save himself and his demons from hell that God has purposely created because of them.</p>
        <p>Who can be saved? You can be saved if you divorce your will for the will of God. You can be saved if you forsake the gods of pride, fornication, adultery, lying, cheating, and seductiveness.</p>
        <p>Our God is a jealous God. He said “have no other gods besides me” it is a command that must be obeyed. That thing you exalt above God is your god and it will rub you of your salvation. Your eyes are your gods if you cannot do with looking at everything you see, to satisfaction, and which thereafter make you end up erecting image of corruption in your mind.</p>
        <p>You can’t close your ears against evil talks, thereafter, you become a servant of Satan, through evil prophesy, evil counsel, Rock music etc.</p>
        <p>Your belly is your god, for you cannot fail to satisfy it one day. To fast is a problem, and because you cannot do without eating, you eat food of initiation. Are you not a witch, wizard or familiar spirit now?</p>
        <p>What is the purpose of God in creating all the private parts of my body, said somebody, if I fail to utilize it to the full? Won’t God query me at the end? How then will you be saved when you are misusing your private parts? How many sex partners have you? Their number is the number of evil spirits in your life, because you are one with each of them already. How will you be saved when you are using your private parts to pull down saints of God and to corrupt innocent souls?</p>
        <p>Who can then be saved? Only eight people were saved during the time of Noah. All other perished. Only Lot and his two daughters were finally saved from Sodom. All others perished. Now we say don’t commit adultery, fornication, don’t tell lie, don’t steal nor cheat, backbite, don’t dress seductively, be mindful of what you watch, eat, do, where you go, etc. Who then can be saved? Grace to sin no more is in Jesus only.</p>
        <p>Accept Jesus and you will be saved, renounce your sins, let your body be under the control of the Spirit of God, let God be in charge of your wealth. Be married to Jesus and not to your wealth. Tell him that you are sorry for all your sins and errors and promise not to go back to them again. You are saved already if you continue with him to the end of your life in holiness and righteousness (praise God).</p>
