          <h1 class="header-2">A HOUSE FOR GOD</h1>
        </div>

      <p>King David promised God a house in 2 Samuel Chapter 7:1-2 God accepted but never allowed him to build it. His son Solomon did after him.</p>
        <p>II Chronicles 6:1-2 “Then said Solomon, the Lord hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness. But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling forever”.</p>
        <p>The question is this, will God indeed dwell with men on earth ‘behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee: how much less this house which I have built:’ said Solomon in verse 18</p>
        <p>God has no interest in dwelling in the house built with hand. The house that God desires is your whole body. Some people went to Jesus and they asked him, whether it is good or not, to pay tax to Ceaser. Jesus answered and said, give that which is Ceaser’s to Ceaser and that which is God’s to God”. The coin that was brought to Jesus had Ceaser’s image inscribed on it. It was therefore Cease’s (own)!</p>
        <p>But they brought it, including Ceaser himself are God’s own because they are created in His image.</p>
        <p>Jesus said “Behold, I stand at the door and knock: If any man hears my voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me (Rev. 3:20)”.</p>
        <p>The door of the house that Jesus is knocking on, is your heart; when you open up the door of your heart for him, He will enter. Don’t think of one house somewhere, don’t think of your huge mansions or your father’s house, it is your very self. YOUR HEART. Hear what he says again in John 14:23 “… if a man loves me, he will keep my words: and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him”</p>
        <p>God the father, Son and Holy Spirit is looking for a compete house to dwell in, would you release your own to Him today? And as you do, would you release all? This is because majority of people that are coming to Jesus only give part of their house to Him and not all.</p>
        <p>You should know that your body has many rooms i.e the head is there, the eye, the mouth, the ear, the stomach, the hands, the legs etc, God wants you to give Him the whole of you. Don’t behave like that rich man in Matthew 19 that wanted to serve God but not with his wealth.</p>
        <p>Give God your brain for you to think righteously, give God your hand for you to use it to God’s glory, give God your eyes so you will be free from lust of the eyes. Give God your tongue then you will overcome misuses of tongues. Give your legs so you will be free from going where you ought not to go.</p>
        <p>Give up your fashion, worldliness, covetousness to God and be perfect before God.</p>
        <p>A house for God. You are that house. He says; What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own? I Cor. 6:19 Every part of your body is God’s own you must not give it to fornication (I Cor. 6:15).</p>
        <p>Accept Jesus today and he will take over the whole of you as you forsake Satan and his sinful works.</p>
