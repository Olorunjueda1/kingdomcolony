          <h1 class="header-2">EAGLES’ WINGS</h1>
        </div>

      <p>An adage says the child that opens up his arms, the people will carry. In other words, assistance may not be rendered to the fellow that requests not for it, even though it is within your power to render such. The Eagle is a type of bird that is so powerful. From year to year the eagle renews its strength by shedding away old wings for new ones.</p>
        <p>As a result of this, neither storm of whirlwind is a threat or a barrier to eagle when flying. Infact the storm is even a source of strength to it.</p>
        <p>Exodus 19:4b makes us to know that Israelites were borne on eagle’s wings from Egypt.</p>
        <p>God did not just carry them on eagle’s wings like that until they themselves opened up their arms unto God. God told Moses in Exodus 2:23 “… Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. In Exodus 3:9 God said “now therefore, behold the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them”.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that God heard the cry of his people He could not do anything until He sent Moses to them to tell them about the God of their fathers; whose name was Jehovah. Not until the Israelites recognized the God of their fathers, and were convinced that God is God, God is Jehovah, were they able to submit to him through His sent servant (Moses).</p>
        <p>The submission of Israel to God was the lifting up of their arms to God for Him to carry them. Their acceptance to go on three days journey into the wilderness was also an act of lifting up of their arms to God to bare them on eagles’ wings.</p>
        <p>You may be wondering in your heart or be asking your friends and leaders if God does not see what you are passing through? “if He is God” you may say or think, ‘why can’t he intervene and deliver me?’ is God not seeing that my days are going? Why can’t he give my husband, my children, money, success, and breakthrough? if he is God indeed.</p>
        <p>The Eagle’s wings of God that carried the Israelites out of the house of bondage is still there to bare you out of all your problem, if you yourself can recognize Him as God, and submit yourself to him as the Israelites did.</p>
        <p>Sir/Ma, you need to open up your arms to God, for Him to carry you on His eagle’s wings. The Israelites spent not less than 40 years in their journey to the Promised Land, but hear this report from Nehemiah 9:21 “Yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their cloths waxed not old, and their feet swelled not”. How will this be possible if not that they were riding on God’s eagles wings?</p>
        <p>The journey to the kingdom of God cannot be embarked upon alone, because there are Red seas, sickness, death etc on the way, you need eagle’s wings to carry you through.</p>
        <p>Jesus is the Eagles wings that God the father has provided to carry you through “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” Act 4:12. Jesus is ready for you; would you now open up your arms to Him for your salvation? As you do by confessing and forsaking your sins, as you do by renouncing Satan completely and by accepting Jesus as your Lord and savior, He (Jesus) will carry you right now on his eagle’s wings and so you will be saved forever (Amen).</p>
