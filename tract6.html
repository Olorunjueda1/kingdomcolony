          <h1 class="header-2">IS HELL REAL?</h1>
        </div>

      <p>People talk about hell, especially those that call themselves Christians or believers. But does hell really exist? If yes, where then is it? And if it is true that hell exists, can God be so wicked to throw or cast into hell those whom He has created in His own image? Why are the so-called believers saying, without accepting Jesus as Lord and savior, one cannot escape hell? Then where will the trillions of others sets of religious people be?</p>
        <p>Well, beloved brothers and sister, Hell is Real. God said it in his word. Other popular religion also confirmed by talking about “Jaanama” in their holy book.</p>
        <p>From the bible we read about the rich man that failed to do God’s will while on earth. He also, during his life time, queried the reality of hell, until he found himself on the other side, and then believed that hell was real, though it was too late (Luke 16-23-28).</p>
        <p>Hell exists, and from the Bible, we are made to know that hell is beneath, that is (under the ground). Isaiah 5:14 said “therefore hell hath enlarged himself and opened her mouth without measure ---descend into it”. If it is not beneath why does the bible talk about people descending into it? I also heard of some gold miners that excavated the ground to the point of hearing peoples shout and crying from hell.</p>
        <p>Is God wicked? No He is not, He never tempts anybody with evil neither can you too tempt him with any. God doesn’t want anybody created in His image to go to hell, for hell was not originally prepared for human beings but for Satan and his angles that rebelled against Him.</p>
        <p>Hell is real, I have heard life testimonies from those that passed out of the body and found themselves in hell, and who, because of God’s mercy were given another chance to come back to the world, in order to make some amendment.</p>
        <p>Also, Choo Nam and Mary Baxter had the opportunity of visiting hell several times and they made us to know through their books Heaven is so Real and Divine Revelation of Hell, that hell is indeed real and people that are there are forever there. Some because of just anger, abortion, lie, hatred, bitterness etc. Even though they were Christians. Some are there because they out-rightly refused to accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior and so they held to their good moral life, which failed to deliver them from hell.</p>
        <p>Of a truth, NO JESUS NO HEAVEN. God is extremely holy. Even His angels are not holy before Him: yet they don’t have their own Will and they are not carrying blood and flesh. How much more, those of us that comes from corruption (dust). No matter our high moral standard and self righteousness before God, we are just like filthy rags (Isa. 64:6).</p>
        <p>Acceptable righteousness to God from His creature could not be gotten through killing of Rams, Goats, etc. Infact, blood of man before God for sacrifice is a serious abomination, because such a person used for sacrifice is only sent to hell to increase the population.</p>
        <p>Yet God loves His creature (human beings) He created them to take over the position of Satan and the fallen angles. But how? Through the blood of His Son Jesus that conquered sin, Satan, death and the grave.</p>
        <p>The blood of this Jesus is shed to redeem you from hell, sin, curses, evil covenants etc. it is this blood that is acceptable before God. Without this blood you cannot stand before God. Your hundred times ablution cannot make you clean enough to stand before God, only the blood of God (Jesus) Himself can.</p>
        <p>Brothers and sisters accept Jesus now by confessing and forsaking your sins and be free from hell. If you accept Him, His blood will cleanse you and make you acceptable unto God.</p>
        <p>Brothers and sisters accept Jesus now by confessing and forsaking your sins and be free from hell. If you accept Him, His blood will cleanse you and make you acceptable unto God.</p>
