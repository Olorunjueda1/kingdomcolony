          <h1 class="header-2">WHAT IS STRONG AS DEATH?</h1>
        </div>

      <p>What people fear most is death? Nobody loves to die whether a believer (Christian) or an unbeliever. But somebody says “Death is a necessary end that come when it is time” The bible even talks of the enemy that shall be destroyed last and that enemy is death (I Cor. 15:26).</p>
        <p>Death is strong, it has been killing great and small, right from the time of Adam and is still killing, up till now, and it will continue to kill until when God will bring it to judgment by destroying him.</p>
        <p>Death is strong indeed. But what is strong as death? King Solomon in songs of Solomon chapter 8:6 said “love is strong as death” How? Love is also strong. Nothing can put off the fire of love; affliction, torture, attack, poverty, riches, beauty or ugliness. Even death threat cannot put off the fire of Love.</p>
        <p>While people were dying in the camp of the Israelites, the love that existed between a man and woman pushed them to continue in immorality until the javelin of Phinehas the son of Eleaser pierced through both of them.</p>
        <p>What am I saying? I am telling you that love does not fear death. Love will make you risk your only life for your lover. Love could push you to selling all you have to buy back your lover from problem.</p>
        <p>The same love that God has for men, made Him to send His only begotten son to the world to save Man. The same love made the son of God forsake His glory. The same love made Him to face Satan face to face.</p>
        <p>This same love made Him to face death on the cross face to face. The same love made Him to suffer shamefully in the hands of His creation. He himself said that He (Jesus) laid down His life for His friends. It was His Love that motivated Him to do so. The love of God in Jesus made Him (Jesus) to be stronger than death. Infact, another name for God is Love.</p>
        <p>I John 4:8, “For God is Love” God Himself is an embodiment of Love. When you have His Love in you, it will make you also to be stronger than death.</p>
        <p>Your Love for God will make you hate sin, Satan and any kind of wickedness; your Love for God will make you to even hate yourself and cleave to God at all cost. It will make you to do extraordinary things for God. Your Love for God binds you to holiness and righteousness; by this love you become inseparable from God, His Son and His Spirit.</p>
        <p>Brother, you just have to answer this question. Whom have you given your Love to? Sin, Satan or God? If it is sin and Satan, anything God’s, heaven, holiness etc will be far away from you and that is why you will ever be an enemy of God (James 4:4) because physical death cannot stop you from eternal death to come, since you have already fallen in love with hell.</p>
        <p>But you can allow the Spirit of God into your life by giving your love to God who loves forever, who sent His son Jesus to the world because of you by accepting Him as your Lord and Saviour and by forsaking sins and Satan. Then death will not be able to stop you from eternal life to come, since you are already in love with love of God (Jesus). God bless you.</p>
