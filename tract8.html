          <h1 class="header-2">WHEN YOU WAKE UP</h1>
        </div>

      <p>Sleep is a must for every living thing. No beast will not sleep one time or the other people even believe that tress and grasses also sleep.</p>
        <p>A man/woman that sleeps and wakes up will give thanks to his/her creator; for no man or woman knows what came over him/her when asleep.</p>
        <p>When people or even animals wake up from sleep not all of them will be alright and sound healthwise. Not all will still be able to do as he/she did the previous day. Not all that slept with greater anointing will wake up to meet it so. Not all that slept with spiritual soundness will still wake up sound.</p>
        <p>Why? This is because of the powers of darkness that work with the night. Demons, witches, wizards, familiar spirits and all sorts of wicked people, operate better in the night, and when men sleep, they will come and sow evil: sickness, bareness, weakness, impurity, failure, ill-luck, curses, etc into them, and when they wake up, they will neither be as agile nor as healthy as they were the day before. Spiritually they won’t be sound again.</p>
        <p>Well, this is the good news; Jesus has conquered Satan, the head of spiritual wickedness that operates both in the day and in the night. He has bruised his head through His death on the cross and his resurrection. He (Jesus) is now sitting at the right hand side of God far above all powers, principalities, rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness. The only thing you need to do is to accept Jesus into your life so that you may sit together with Him in the heavenly places far above all those powers mentioned above.</p>
        <p>Until you are higher than Satan and his demons you cannot overcome wickedness. Until you are higher than Satan you cannot destroy his works in your life and you cannot be higher than him except you allow Jesus who has conquered him once and for all, to have full possession of you.</p>
        <p>Look! Until you have Jesus in you, you cannot wake up into life eternal when you at last sleep the sleep of death. The ten Virgins with lamps and anointing slept off at the point of waiting for the bridegroom.</p>
        <p>When the bridegroom came, five of them woke up to have shortage of anointing because they failed to carry extra oil along with them; instead of waking up to enter in with the bridegroom they woke up to be looking for oil; which at last ended them up outside for life.</p>
        <p>When you at last wake up from the sleep of death where will you wake up into? Life or death Eternal? Alas and behold! It is appointed unto man to die once, after it, is judgment (Heb: 9:27).</p>
        <p>You don’t need to wait till you sleep the sleep of death and then wake up to know the truth. Then, it would have become too late to decide anything again. This is the time for you to decide for your eternal life through Jesus. This is the time you need to embrace the blood of Jesus for your redemption from eternal death and condemnation. This is the time you need to forsake Satan, and accept Jesus as your Lord and savior. You must not sleep before you do it, a minute’s delay may end up in your walking into eternal destruction. Accept Him (Jesus) Now. For He is the one that will stand for you to usher you in into eternal life. Don’t wait any longer, “behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation” 2 Cor. 6:2b. not a minute after now, it is NOW.</p>
