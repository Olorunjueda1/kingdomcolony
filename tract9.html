        </div>

      <p>Ignorance, they say, is not an excuse in the law court. Satan loves to work or operate on people’s ignorance, because, the more ignorant you are of his tricks, the more he takes advantage of you.</p>
        <p>Therefore, get acquainted with some of his tricks through these questions and the responses to them.</p>
        <p>Where are the herbalists today? They are no longer in the hamlet or inside a hut; they are now in Churches as Pastors and Founder of Churches!</p>
        <p>Where are the Magicians? They are also in the Churches as Pastors, Prophets and Founders of Churches, working signs and wonders through their magical powers under the pretence of the name of Jesus.</p>
        <p>Hear what the scriptures say in Matthew 7:16 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits not by their signs and wonders, but by their fruits, by the type of life they live you shall know them, whether or not they are for God.</p>
        <p>Why are graduates not getting jobs nowadays, even born again Christians? It is to afflict them with poverty so that they will be forced to renounce their faith in Jesus.</p>
        <p>Why are people, even Christians afflicted with sickness and all forms of problems? So that they may curse God and turn to Satan. Reason for Job’s affliction was not because of unrighteousness but for Job to curse God to His face but Satan failed at last.</p>
        <p>Why is bareness in the church? It is just for people to seek for demonic child or children from Satan.</p>
        <p>Why is delay in married rampant in the Church today? It is so, because he wants them to marry outside the will of God.</p>
        <p>God said in His word that knowledge will increase. Indeed knowledge is increasing. Now you don’t need to go and buy pornographic pictures or blue films before you watch the nakedness of opposite sex and even see sexual abuse in action so long you have your handset, satellite dish or cable. Even through the internet you see all these things live.</p>
        <p>The computer is also there for you to occupy yourself with and then forget about going for fellowship.</p>
        <p>Also the spirit of football has baptized all the people of the world! Football has now become a god that the world is now worshipping instead of Jehovah God of heaven and earth.</p>
        <p>Christian that have renounced sin have in another way embrace sin back through the spirit of “it doesn’t matter” e.g it doesn’t matter to dress half naked; it does not matter to wear attires meant for the opposite sex, it does not matter to visit and sleep with an opposite sex alone; it doesn’t matter if you as a lady have your head uncovered when praying.</p>
        <p>These, and many yet unmentioned are the tricks of Satan to take you away from the will and purpose of God, which is, BE YE HOLY UNTO ME (GOD)”. Not only inward holiness, even external holiness that will indeed sever you from the world.</p>
        <p>God said the time of ignorance He (God) winked at but He is now commanding you to come to repentance (Act 17:30) YES! You must have been polluted through one or two of these tricks. All you need to do is to pray to God for mercy, forgiveness and for purging and you will be free.</p>
        <p>You are by now not ignorant of the devil’s devices (tricks), lest Satan should get an advantage of you (2 Cor. 2:11).</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus in full and He will save you to the end.</p>
